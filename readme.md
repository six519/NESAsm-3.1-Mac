# Nesasm 3.1

This is a simple copy of NESAsm 3.1 with an added makefile for OS X. You will need to have Xcode installed (the Makefile uses clang to compile the files).

I do not own any of the code, none of it has been modified. The compilation throws some warnings, but still succeeds. The license header is copied below.
